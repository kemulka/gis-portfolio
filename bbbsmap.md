# Custom Google Map Theme for Big Brothers Big Sisters

For this exercise I chose to develop a map theme for the organization Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) of America - a renowned national youth mentoring organization. I worked with the local Pittsburgh chapter on a consulting project for a class last year, so I am quite familiar with their work (it's great, btw!). 

BBBS Website: https://www.bbbs.org/about-us/

Their website is already consistently themed, so I took a screen grab of the bottom of the About Us page, which features the logo and the website color scheme:

Then I uploaded the image into Canva to get the color pallete:

Using Google's Map Styling Wizard, I created a new map using the Silver style. I thought this was a smart choice since silver is already a color in the pallete and will serve as a neutral base to contrast well with the bright green color. From there I played around with altering the colors of the map elements. 

The final theme elements are set as follows:

Labels - Marshland with white halo
Land - Silver
Water - Spring Green
Parks - Boulder
Roads and transit features - map style default

My thinking is that BBBS would benefit from having a map on their national website displaying all of the regional branches. Since they have branches across the US, the map would be viewed at the national and local levels. What would matter is highlighting the offices on the map (I envision these in Spring Green), so I kept the land features neutral. There will be no offices in the water, so I chose to incorporate the Spring Green there. I like how the water pops without making the land area look busy.

As an alternative, I tried making the labels green to add more color to the map. Ultimately I felt the map could work this way on its own but when adding the BBBS offices as points it would make the land are look too busy (this styling was scrapped in favor of the simpler black labels pictured above).
