This is my repository for the Spring 2022 graduate course Advanced GIS.


# About me
Hello, I'm Kelsey!
(She / Her / Hers)

Prior to coming to grad school, I worked for a public policy research organization that fueled my interest in developing my technical skill set as it relates to policy analysis and data-driven decision making, leading me right to Heinz College.

I am graduating from the MSPPM program in May and am looking forward to spending the summer traveling (locations TBD) before starting a new position as a federal strategy consultant.

# What I hope to learn
I am interested in advancing my knowledge of GIS tools and techniques through Esri's suite of services and open source platforms. I am currently working on a project to develop methods for identiying solid waste deposits with the UNDP using satellite imagery and 'non-traditional' geographic data sources, so I hope to come away with some analysis ideas to apply to that project, as well.  Lastly, I love transportation data and would be very happy to delve more into network maps.
